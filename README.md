- Local storage for high score persistence
- Optimized for both touch and mouse/keyboard input
- Clean separation of game components (UI, physics, controls)
- No external dependencies required

## Development

The game is structured into multiple JavaScript modules:

- `main.js`: Game initialization and setup
- `game.js`: Core game loop and state management
- `player.js`: Player character controls and physics
- `collectibles.js`: Power-up and scoring items
- `obstacles.js`: Obstacle generation and behavior
- `level.js`: Level design and difficulty progression
- `ui.js`: User interface and HUD elements
- `assets.js`: Game assets and resource management
- `utils.js`: Utility functions
- `sprites.js`: Sprite animation system
